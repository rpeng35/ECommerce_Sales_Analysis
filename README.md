### Key Observations
#### Categories:
- Best selling category is Health & Beauty which peaked in the third quater of 2018 with a total of 317942 in price
- Top 3 best selling categories are all female-oriented categories

#### Market Trend:
- There is a constant growth in total sales until the third quater of 2018
- There is a 1 million difference in total sales between the first quater of 2018 and the third quater

#### States and Regions:
- São Paulo contributes approximately half of total sales; there is a significant disparity in sales and orders between São Paulo and other states
- Since São Paulo makes up almost half of total sales, the flutuation in sales in São Paulo is related to the fall in total sales in 2018 Q3

### Recommendations & Next Steps:
- Investigate the fall in total sales in 2018 Q3 and compare Olist's sales trend to industry averages and benchmarks to further assess performance and seasonality in sales
- While São Paulo contributes most to total sales, would be a good idea to implement targeted advevtising campaigns to attract more customers for South-West Expansion
- Continue to focus on targeted advertising for the top 3 categories, especially health_beauty to retain female customers
